Game Technology Fifth Project, April 2022.

Michael Betar's fifth Project for his Game Technology Class. This one focuses on the Foundations of 3D in a first person setting.

## Implementation
Added Main Menu.
Has a moveable character controlled by the Player.
Randomly generates Maze for Player to transverse.
Multiple uses of CSG.
Added textures to walls and floor.
Added Music to Game.
Changed Font for Main Title Screen.

## References
Past Exercises.

## Future Development
Likely None. 
Maybe I implement some adjustments post-turn in. I could not fit in time to add more to this project as it had taken me longer than expected for what I was able to turn in before the due date.
